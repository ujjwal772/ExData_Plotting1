## Introduction

The folder <b>scripts</b> has the necessary R scripts and plots of the project 1 in Exploratory Data Analysis course.

To reduce code-duplication, I have kept the common data import and preprocessing steps in the script <b>preProcessData.R</b>. Every plot#.R script first sources this script to do the necessary steps and then carries on with their respective plots.

Sufficient comments are provided in the scripts to guide the reader.
